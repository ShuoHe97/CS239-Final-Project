Use paths as constraints  {#tutorial_pychrono_demo_paths}
===========================

Create two pendulums following paths (i.e. parametric lines).
Uses [PyChrono](@ref pychrono_introduction).

Learn how to:

- create piecewise paths built from sub-lines, and visualize them
- add a constraint of 'curvilinear glyph' type (the body can freely move with one of its points being constrained to slide along a path)
- add a constraint of 'imposed trajectory' type (the body must with one of its points being constrained to walk along a path as a parametric line with motion function)
