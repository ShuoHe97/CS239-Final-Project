Load from SolidWorks and raytrace with POVray  {#tutorial_pychrono_demo_solidworks_pov}
==================================

Import a SolidWorks scene into your PyChrono program, simulate it and render with POVray.

The Chrono::Solidworks add-in can be used in SolidWorks to export an assembly 
into a .py file that can be later load and simulated.

Uses [PyChrono](@ref pychrono_introduction).

Learn how to:

- use the Chrono::SolidWorks Add-In for exporting a mechanical system
- load the system in PyChrono and simulate it
- visualize it with POVray scripts for rendering a 3D animation
