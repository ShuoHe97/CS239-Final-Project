Irrlicht assets example (demo_IRR_assets.cpp)  {#tutorial_demo_irr_assets}
==========================


Use the assets system to create shapes that can be
shown in the Irrlicht 3D view. 

This tutorial shows how to:

- add geometric visualization shapes to an object.
- visualize them in the realtime view of Irrlicht. 

Note: the same assets that you use for Irrlicht display 
can be used for postprocessing, ex. with POVray as 
explained in [demo_POST_povray](\ref tutorial_demo_povray).
