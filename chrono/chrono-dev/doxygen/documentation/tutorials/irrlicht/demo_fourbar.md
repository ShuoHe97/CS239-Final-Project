Four-bar linkage example (demo_IRR_fourbar.cpp)  {#tutorial_demo_fourbar}
==========================

This tutorial is similar to the demo_crank example, 
but here a small user-interface is created, so that 
the user can play with a slider to modify the speed 
of the motor. 

The user interface is created with simple GUI features 
of Irrlicht, but other kind of interfaces/visualization 
systems could be used. 

Here you can also learn:

-  how to make a four-bar linkage
-  an example of how to plot/fetch data during the simulation.
-  use a direct solver instead of iterative solver, for 
   highest precision.
