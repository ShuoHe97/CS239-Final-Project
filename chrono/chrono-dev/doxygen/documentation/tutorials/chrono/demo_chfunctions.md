Using ChFunctions in Chrono (demo_CH_functions.cpp) {#tutorial_demo_chfunctions}
==========================

Tutorial that teaches how to use the ChFunction inherited classes to build math functions of y=f(x) type. The ChFunction objects are 'building blocks' whose main usage is to describe motion laws, such as trajectories in automation and robotics, etc.

- create and use ChFunction objects, from available classes.
- define a custom function by inheriting from ChFunction class.
- use the ChFunction_Sequence to build a sequence of basic functions
- No GUI: only text output.
