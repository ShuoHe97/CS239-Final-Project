Perform electrostatics analysis   (demo_FEA_electrostatics.cpp)  {#tutorial_demo_FEA_electrostatics}
===============================================================


Tutorial that teaches how to use the 
[FEA module](group__chrono__fea.html)
to compute the electrostatic solution for a volume (Poisson problem) given boundary conditions. The tetrahedral mesh is imported from an Abaqus file. There are two node sets (boundaries) where high voltage is applied. The rest of the volume is considered to be air.
