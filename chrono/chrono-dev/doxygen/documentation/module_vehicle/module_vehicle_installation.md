Install the VEHICLE module   {#module_vehicle_installation}
===============================

[TOC]

This is an optional module that enables template-based ground vehicle 
modeling and simulation within Chrono.

Read [the introduction to modules](modularity.html) for a technical 
background on the modularity of the Chrono project.


## Features

The **VEHICLE module** allows users to model and simulate vehicles. 

Here are the main features:

- template-based definition of vehicles
- both tracked and wheeled vehicles
- different types of tire models
	- Pacejka
	- Fiala
	- deformable FEA (multi-layer ANCF shell elements)
	- rigid
- different types of soil models
	- rigid
	- deformable SCM (Soil Contact Model)
	- deformable FEA (ANCF solid elements)
	- granular
- use JSON for easy specification of models (vehicles and sub-systems)
- different types of suspensions for wheeled vehicles
	- double wishbone
	- multilink
	- solid axle
	- McPherson
	- semi-trailing arm
	- Hendrickson
- various templates for segmented tracks
    - single-pin track shoes
    - double-pin track shoes
- driveline and powertrain 1D primitives
	- clutches
	- thermal engines
	- reducers
	- gears
	- planetary gears
- driver models
    - interactive (Irrlicht key and mouse controls)
    - closed-loop (path-follower, constant speed controller, etc.)


## Requirements

- To **run** applications based on this module there are no requirements

- To **build** applications based on this module there are no requirements


## Building instructions
   
1. Repeat the instructions for the [full installation](@ref tutorial_install_chrono), but when you see the CMake window, you must add the following steps:
   
2. Set the `ENABLE_MODULE_VEHICLE` as 'on', then press 'Configure' (to refresh the variable list) 
	 
3. Press 'Configure' again, then 'Generate', and proceed as usual in the installation instructions.


## How to use it

- Look at the [API section](group__vehicle.html) of this module for documentation about classes and functions.

- Look at the C++ source of [demos](@ref tutorial_table_of_content_chrono_vehicle) to learn how to use the functions of this module.
